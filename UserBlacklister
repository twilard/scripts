--[[
when a username that you enter in the table below joins the game,
it will kick you automatically so they don't see you exploiting
i use it with staff member's names so if they join i dont get banned
]]

usernames = {"username","other username","another username lol"}
game:GetService("Players").PlayerAdded:Connect(function(plr)
for i,v in pairs(usernames) do
if plr.Name == v then
game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer:Kick(plr.Name.." has joined the game")
end
end
